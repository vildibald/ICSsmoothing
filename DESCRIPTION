Title: Data smoothing by interpolating cubic splines
Version: 1.1.0
Author: Juraj Hudak
Maintainer: Juraj Hudak <juraj.hudak1@student.upjs.sk>
Description: We construct the explicit form of clamped cubic interpolating spline (both uniform -knots
    are equidistant and non-uniform - knots are arbitrary). Using this form, we propose a linear
    regression model suitable for real data smoothing.
